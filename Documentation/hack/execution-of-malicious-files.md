# Execution of Malicious Files 

## Definition 

Execution of malicious files involves running unauthorized or harmful software, known as malware, on a computer system. This includes a variety of threats like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

## How It Works 

1. **Infiltration**: Malicious files sneak into a system via email attachments, compromised websites, or downloads.
2. **Activation**: The malware springs into action when the file is executed.
3. **Propagation**: Some malware can replicate and spread to other systems.
4. **Execution**: The malware carries out its damaging activities.

## Detection 

1. **Antivirus Software**: Employs signatures and heuristics to spot malware.
2. **Network Monitoring**: Watches for unusual network activity signaling malware.
3. **Behavior Analysis**: Identifies odd system behavior that suggests malicious actions.
4. **File Integrity Monitoring**: Verifies for unsanctioned changes in files.

## Prevention 

1. **Regular Software Updates**: Ensures all software, including security programs, are current.
2. **Employee Training**: Teaches how to recognize dubious files and phishing attempts.
3. **Firewalls**: Restricts network traffic based on security guidelines.
4. **Safe Browsing Practices**: Avoids risky websites and untrusted downloads.

## Example Scenarios 

1. **Ransomware Attack**: Data gets encrypted and held for ransom.
2. **Trojan Horse**: Malicious code hidden inside seemingly legitimate software.
3. **Email Phishing**: System infection through malicious email attachments.

## How to do it? 

1. **Set Up a Safe Environment**: Use a controlled setting like a virtual machine.
2. **Obtain Test Malware Samples**: From sources like [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) or [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/).
3. **Run and Monitor**: Execute the malware and observe with security tools.
